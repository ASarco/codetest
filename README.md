# KRY code assignment

One of our developers built a simple service poller.
The service consists of a backend service that keeps a list of services, and periodically checks if they are up or down.

Unfortunately, the original developer din't finish the job, and it's now up to you to complete the thing.
In the backlog are the following issues:

- Whenever the server is restarted, any added services disappear
- There's no way to DELETE individual services
- The poller doesn't actually work
- The frontend needs some work
- Simultaneous writes sometimes causes strange behavior
- There's only one test and it only tests the GET endpoint

Spend maximum two hours working on these issues - if you can solve all of them, great!
If you cannot finish all of them, try to finish the ones you start.

Good luck!
